## Data
- ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer):
- AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer):
- CDP (Comercial Data Purchase Imagery):
- Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion: 10- to 30-meter multispectral and hyperspectral data from the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Extended Mission. (2000-2017)

## Data Portals
- EarthExplorer:
- LandsatLook

# Landsat 1 and Landsat 8 
Provide 30 meter resolution (NIR and SWIR), 100 meters (thermal) and 15 meters (panchromatic).  The data can be downloaded from [https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

These [iPython Notebooks from PyDataNYC2014](https://github.com/HyperionAnalytics/PyDataNYC2014) have an excellent explaination of the different bands and how to process them. 

## Landsat Viewer
The [Landsat Viewer](https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/) page is a great place to preview Landsat imagery.  I havent played with this much but will report more once I have. 

# ASTER TERRA
The ASTER sensor is mounted on the TERRA satellite and provides high resolution (15m-90m) images in 14 bands including visible to near infrared bands (VNIR bands 1-3), six shortwave infrared bands (SWIR bands 4-9) and five thermal or long wave infrared bands (TIR bands 10-14).  ASTER images map surface temperature, emissivity and reflectance of the earths surface.  L1A is raw data and L1B is radiometrically and geometrically corrected.  Data are available from [http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/](http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/).
