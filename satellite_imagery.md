# Satellite Imagery and Python

# Landsat 1 and Landsat 8 
Provide 30 meter resolution (NIR and SWIR), 100 meters (thermal) and 15 meters (panchromatic).  The data can be downloaded from [https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

These iPython Notebooks have an excellent explaination of the different bands and how to process them.  

# ASTER TERRA
The ASTER sensor is mounted on the TERRA satellite and provides high resolution (15m-90m) images in 14 bands including visible to near infrared bands (VNIR bands 1-3), six shortwave infrared bands (SWIR bands 4-9) and five thermal or long wave infrared bands (TIR bands 10-14).  ASTER images map surface temperature, emissivity and reflectance of the earths surface.  L1A is raw data and L1B is radiometrically and geometrically corrected.  Data are available from [http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/](http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov/reverb/).
