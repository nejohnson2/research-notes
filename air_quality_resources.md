# Air Quality

## Public Lab

The [Open Air](https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-quality) initiative by Public Lab has lots of resources.

## Data Sources
- [EPA AQ Data Page](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)
- [NYS DEC](http://www.dec.ny.gov/airmon/index.php) - This has information about all sites with images but does not have an easy to access data portal.
- [NYS DEC Air Quality Index Now](http://www.nyaqinow.net/) - This is the best source of information though accessing it is still difficult.
